"""
Lennard-Jones 6-atom cluster function implementation.

This module implements the Lennard-Jones potential energy function for a cluster
of 6 identical atoms, a classic benchmark in computational chemistry and physics.
The function has a highly rugged energy landscape with thousands of local minima,
making it challenging for optimization algorithms.

    """
    Lennard-Jones 6-atom cluster potential energy function (SPSO ID-17).
    
    This function calculates the 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential energy for a cluster
    of six identical atoms. The atoms' positions are represented by their Cartesian
    coordinates in reduced units (σ=ε=1).
    
    Mathematical definition:
    E(r) = 4 * ∑_{i<j} [(rij)^(-12) - (rij)^(-6)]
    
    where rij is the Euclidean distance between atoms i and j.
    
    Global minimum: E = -12.7121 at the octahedral (Oh) structure.
    
    Attributes:
        dimension (int): Always 18 (6 atoms × 3 coordinates).
        bounds (np.ndarray): Default bounds are [-2, 2] for each coordinate.
    
    Properties:
        - Highly multimodal (thousands of local minima)
        - Non-separable
        - Continuous but very rugged landscape
        - Multiple degenerate global minima (due to translational/rotational symmetry)
